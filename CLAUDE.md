## Project North Star

Before writing or modifying any code in this project, read and internalize `bible.md` at the project root. It defines the engineering philosophy, quality standards, and behavioral expectations for all work in this codebase.

Every decision — naming, architecture, error handling, refactoring — must align with the principles documented there. When in doubt, re-read the bible.
